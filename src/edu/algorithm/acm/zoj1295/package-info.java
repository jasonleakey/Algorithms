 * Reverse Text
 * Time Limit: 2 Seconds Memory Limit: 65536 KB
 * 
 * In most languages, text is written from left to right. However, there are
 * other languages where text is read and written from right to left. As a first
 * step towards a program that automatically translates from a left-to-right
 * language into a right-to-left language and back, you are to write a program
 * that changes the direction of a given text.
 * 
 * Input Specification
 * 
 * The input contains several test cases. The first line contains an integer
 * specifying the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line
 * of text which contains at most 70 characters. However, the newline character
 * at the end of each line is not considered to be part of the line.
 * 
 * 
 * Output Specification
 * 
 * For each test case, print a line containing the characters of the input line
 * in reverse order.
 * 
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 
 * 3
 * Frankly, I don't think we'll make much
 * money out of this scheme.
 * madam I'm adam

 * Sample Output
 *
